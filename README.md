# Sega-Site-Recreation
My first project. A recreation of the official Sega website.
Whilst still learning CSS, as a method of practising my skills, I decided to recreate the official Sega website from scratch simply by looking at the existing site without viewing any of it's code. In the end I ended up adding a few small tweaks to it in regard to colour schemes and small details.
